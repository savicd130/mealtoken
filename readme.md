# Meal Token

This is a full stack app, based on a restaurant food store.

It is done using the following technologies: `Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React`.

To use it, you need to download the complete file, use the command line to enter the mealtoken folder and do the `yarn install`, then go to the client folder and do the `yarn install` in it as well.

The server is started in the mealtoken folder using `yarn start`, and it is located on the port `http://localhost:5000`.

While running the client page in the client folder using `yarn start`, it is also located on the `http://localhost:3000` port.

Due to Access-Control-Allow-Origin, I recommend that you use the Chrome browser to install the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en
